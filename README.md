## Documentation / Installation

Documentation is available on our [Documentation Wiki](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACECRIS/Technical+and+User+documentation) please check also the documentation from the parent DSpace project as basic features and principle are common and only described in the [DSpace documentation](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC/).

The latest DSpace Installation instructions are available at:
https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Installing+DSpace

some extra step to initialize te DSpace-CRIS with proper default can be found in our documentation (see above)

Please be aware that, as a Java web application, DSpace-CRIS requires a database (PostgreSQL)
and a servlet container (usually Tomcat) in order to function.
More information about these and all other prerequisites can be found in the Installation instructions above.

## Running DSpace-CRIS 7 in Docker

NOTE: At this time, we do not have production-ready Docker images for DSpace-CRIS.
That said, we do have quick-start Docker Compose scripts for development or testing purposes.

Please be aware that, as a Java web application, DSpace-CRIS requires a database (PostgreSQL or Oracle), a servlet container (usually Tomcat) and a SOLR instance in order to function.

More information about these and all other prerequisites can be found in the Installation instructions above.

## Testing

### Running Tests

By default, in DSpace, Unit Tests and Integration Tests are disabled. However, they are
run automatically by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/4Science/DSpace/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild) for all Pull Requests and code commits.

* How to run both Unit Tests (via `maven-surefire-plugin`) and Integration Tests (via `maven-failsafe-plugin`):
  ```
  mvn install -DskipUnitTests=false -DskipIntegrationTests=false
  ```
* How to run _only_ Unit Tests:
  ```
  mvn test -DskipUnitTests=false
  ```
* How to run a *single* Unit Test
  ```
  # Run all tests in a specific test class
  # NOTE: failIfNoTests=false is required to skip tests in other modules
  mvn test -DskipUnitTests=false -Dtest=[full.package.testClassName] -DfailIfNoTests=false

  # Run one test method in a specific test class
  mvn test -DskipUnitTests=false -Dtest=[full.package.testClassName]#[testMethodName] -DfailIfNoTests=false
  ```
* How to run _only_ Integration Tests
  ```
  mvn install -DskipIntegrationTests=false
  ```
* How to run a *single* Integration Test
  ```
  # Run all integration tests in a specific test class
  # NOTE: failIfNoTests=false is required to skip tests in other modules
  mvn install -DskipIntegrationTests=false -Dit.test=[full.package.testClassName] -DfailIfNoTests=false

  # Run one test method in a specific test class
  mvn install -DskipIntegrationTests=false -Dit.test=[full.package.testClassName]#[testMethodName] -DfailIfNoTests=false
  ```
* How to run only tests of a specific DSpace module
  ```
  # Before you can run only one module's tests, other modules may need installing into your ~/.m2
  cd [dspace-src]
  mvn clean install

  # Then, move into a module subdirectory, and run the test command
  cd [dspace-src]/dspace-server-webapp
  # Choose your test command from the lists above
  ```
