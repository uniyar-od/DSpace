# EXAMPLE "local.cfg" for DSpace.
#
# Any configurations added to this file will automatically OVERRIDE configurations
# of the same name in any of the DSpace *.cfg files. This includes overriding
# settings in any of these files:
#    * [dspace]/config/dspace.cfg
#    * Any configuration file that is included in 'dspace.cfg'
#     (See "include = [filepath]" settings near the end of dspace.cfg.
#      By default, it includes all [dspace]/config/modules/*.cfg files)
#    * Spring Boot's application.properties
#      ([dspace-src]/dspace-server-webapp/src/main/resources/application.properties)
#
# By default, this EXAMPLE file includes a number of commonly overridden configurations.
# * ADD configurations by simply copying them into this file from any existing *.cfg file.
# * REMOVE configurations by simply commenting them out or deleting them below.
#
# Any commented out settings in this file are simply ignored. A configuration
# will only override another configuration if it has the EXACT SAME key/name.
# For example, including "dspace.dir" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "dspace.dir" in the dspace.cfg file.
# Similarly, including "oai.solr.url" in this local.cfg will override the
# default value of "oai.solr.url" in the modules/oai.cfg file.

# HANDLE CONFIGURATION #
########################
#
# Canonical Handle URL prefix
#
# Items in DSpace receive a unique URL, stored in dc.identifier.uri
# after it is generated during the submission process.
#
# If you register with CNRI's handle service at https://www.handle.net/,
# these links can be generated as permalinks using https://hdl.handle.net/
# as canonical prefix. Please make sure to change handle.canonical.prefix
# after registering with handle.net by uncommenting one of the following
# lines, depending if you prefer to use https or http:
# handle.canonical.prefix = https://hdl.handle.net/
# handle.canonical.prefix = http://hdl.handle.net/
#
# Note that this will not alter dc.identifier.uri metadata for existing
# items (only for subsequent submissions).

# PROXY CONFIGURATION #
#######################

# AUTHENTICATION METHODS #
##########################
# EXAMPLE OVERRIDE:
# Override the default authentication method(s) defined in authentication.cfg
# by defining your own custom ordered list in this local.cfg.
#
# By default, all of these methods are commented out and DSpace will use the
# settings from authentication.cfg. But you may uncomment whichever plugins you
# need in order to change the default settings (or reorder them below).
#
# You may also copy default settings from the corresponding authentication-*.cfg
# configuration file and override them in this local.cfg.

# IP-based authentication/authorization. See authentication-ip.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.IPAuthentication

# LDAP authentication/authorization. See authentication-ldap.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.LDAPAuthentication

# OIDC authentication/authorization. See authenication-oidc.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.OidcAuthentication

# Shibboleth authentication/authorization. See authentication-shibboleth.cfg for default configuration.
# Check also the cors settings below
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.ShibAuthentication

# X.509 certificate authentication. See authentication-x509.cfg for default configuration.
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.X509Authentication

# Authentication by Password (encrypted in DSpace's database). See authentication-password.cfg for default configuration.
# Enabled by default in authentication.cfg
#plugin.sequence.org.dspace.authenticate.AuthenticationMethod = org.dspace.authenticate.PasswordAuthentication

#####################
# REST API SETTINGS #
#####################
# Allowed Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) origins (in "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header).
# Only these origins (client URLs) can successfully authenticate with your REST API.
# Defaults to ${dspace.ui.url} if unspecified (as the UI must have access to the REST API).
# Multiple allowed origin URLs may be comma separated. Wildcard value (*) is NOT SUPPORTED.
# (Requires reboot of servlet container, e.g. Tomcat, to reload)
# When an external authentication system is involved like Shibboleth some browsers (i.e. Safari) include
# in the request the Origin header with the url of the IdP. In such case you need to allow also the IdP to
# avoid trouble for such browsers (i.e.  rest.cors.allowed-origins = ${dspace.ui.url}, https://samltest.id )
#rest.cors.allowed-origins = ${dspace.ui.url}

# EXAMPLE OVERRIDE:
# By uncommenting the below Spring Boot settings, you can increase or decrease the maximum upload size.
